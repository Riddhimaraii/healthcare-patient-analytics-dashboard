# 🏥 Healthcare Patient Analytics & Decision Support Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing hospital readmission data to understand patient trends, identify high-risk groups, and uncover factors influencing readmissions. The goal is to support data-driven decision-making in healthcare operations using analytics and visualization.

---

## 📊 Dataset
**Hospital Readmissions Dataset (Kaggle)**  
The dataset includes patient demographics, diagnoses, length of stay, admission details, and readmission outcomes.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Python** (Pandas, Matplotlib)
- **SQL**
- **Excel**
- **Power BI**

---

## 🔍 Key Analysis Performed
- Cleaned and structured raw healthcare data for analysis readiness  
- Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) on patient demographics and clinical attributes  
- Analyzed readmission patterns across age groups, diagnoses, and length of stay  
- Identified patient segments associated with higher readmission frequency  
- Evaluated operational trends contributing to increased healthcare costs  

---

## 📈 Dashboard Highlights
The Power BI dashboard provides interactive insights into:
- Readmission rates across patient demographics  
- Average length of stay and cost trends  
- High-risk patient categories  
- Key healthcare KPIs for operational monitoring

## 💡 Key Insights
- Certain age groups and diagnoses show consistently higher readmission rates  
- Longer hospital stays are associated with increased readmission risk  
- Targeted monitoring of high-risk patients can help reduce avoidable readmissions  

---

## 🚀 Outcome
This project demonstrates the application of data analytics and visualization techniques to solve real-world healthcare problems and support informed decision-making.
